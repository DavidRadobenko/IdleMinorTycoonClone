#Gameplay

Touch (with Left Mouse Button) the workers and collect Money to upgrade the workers or buy new floors to work with. 
There are 2 Types of Workers. The brown Cylinder's are the Miners and the Green one's are the Deliveres.
When collected enough money you can buy Manager that will let the workers keep working so you don't have to touch them all the time to get them to work.
When buying Manager's they will spawn with a randomised Ability you can use for a period of time.
